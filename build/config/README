These files were taken from the Linux 2.6.16.7 Kernel
Configuration System and modified for the Zian Project (xiaofeng 2010)

TODO LIST
---------
1. Remove lxdialog, which depends highly on ncurses library.
   Since we visit all via WEB, locally configuration with tty is no use.
   (A re-implementing with Python-GTK or Python-GUI may be considered)

2. Use Python(and PLY, PYGTK, etc.) to replace this in future
